"""Tool search ranked by TypeSafe's Jev.

vendored from PrefectHQ/fastmcp#5170 (fastmcp.experimental.transforms.jev_search)
until that ships in a release the `mcp` extra can pin. keep in sync with the PR.

Jev is a System One model: it does not generate text. A request carries a
``state`` and a map of typed questions, every question is judged against the
same state in parallel, and each answer is a probability distribution over
options the caller defined. That makes it a natural ranker for a tool
catalog: the query is the state, the tool names are the options, and the
probabilities are the ranking.

The transform follows the shape of TypeSafe's skill-suggestion cookbook
(https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/skill_suggestion): a cheap wide pass over
the whole catalog on one-line summaries, then a close read of a shortlist
with each tool's full description and parameters. The close read asks two
kinds of question. A Choice decides *which* candidate fits best and orders
the results. One Noul per candidate decides *whether* it does what the query
asks at all, so a query nothing serves comes back empty instead of returning
the least-wrong tool.

    Experimental: the ranking parameters may change. Requires the ``jev``
    extra (``pip install "fastmcp[jev]"``) and a TypeSafe API key, read from
    ``TYPESAFE_API_KEY`` unless ``api_key`` or ``client`` is given. A missing
    key is an error at construction, not at the first search.

    Tool descriptions are model input. A description written to argue for
    its own selection can move the ranking; the transform only ranks tools
    the caller could already list, so that exposure is bounded by what the
    catalog holds.

    Args:
        model: The TypeSafe model name. ``jev-latest`` follows releases;
            pin a versioned id once you have tuned ``fit_threshold``.
        api_key: TypeSafe API key. Defaults to ``TYPESAFE_API_KEY``.
        client: A ready ``AsyncTypeSafeClient`` (or anything with an async
            ``system_one``) to use instead of building one.
        timeout: Seconds per API attempt when the transform builds its own
            client. A search is one to a few requests.
        shortlist: How many candidates each wide-pass request carries
            forward. The close read sees at most ``3 * shortlist``
            candidates; a larger catalog is narrowed with further wide
            passes first.
        fit_threshold: A candidate whose "does this tool do what the request
            asks" probability falls below this is dropped from the results.
            Tune it against queries from your own users.
        chunk_size: Tools per wide-pass request. Catalogs above this size
            are ranked in concurrent chunks. At most 255, the Choice limit.
        summary_chars: Characters of description per tool in the wide pass.
        detail_chars: Characters of rendered description and parameters per
            tool in the close read.
        max_results, always_visible, search_tool_name, call_tool_name,
